            Our target group are children who no longer have parents or whose parents cannot ensure the child&apos;s best interests. The Children&apos;s Village thus cares for orphaned and abandoned children as well as children who have been victims of neglect, abuse and sexual abuse in their family of origin. Many flee from family violence onto the streets and try to survive there. They try to keep their heads above water with begging, stealing, prostitution and minimally paid work. Many consume cheap drugs such as gasoline and glue to make life more bearable. They are exposed to violent attacks without protection. Street children have been abandoned by their families and society, and do not receive any care, protection or attention.
